# Fractal Quantum Time Loop Simulator

**Author**: Sushavan Ghosh (Boss)

## Description
A simulation of recursive time loops with independent mirror and normal loop systems, 4D embedding, and quantum crossover logic.

## Run the Simulation

Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the simulation:
```
python loop_simulation.py
python visualize_loops.py
```

## Features
- 4D loop structures
- Quantum crossover decision points
- Mirror and Non-Mirror loop systems
- Fractal recursion ready
